TODO: The tyoe if state charts that we are using is a DIRECTED GRAPH with GUARDED EDGES. We have a starting state but not necessarily an ACCEPTING state.

TODO: Our state chart is very similar to an UML state diagram.

TODO: We might consider adapting our state chart to resemble UML digrams but that bit is under consideration. currently it does look very similar but edges do not have the correct formatting for guarded conditions on UML.

TODO: Minor detail, all of our states have an implicit edge going to END and will be used if no other conditions are true. We might consider showing the difference in the two.

TODO: Programming side, we need to enable saving because it's becoming a pain in the -bleep-.
