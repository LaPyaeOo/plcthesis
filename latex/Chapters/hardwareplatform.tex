\section{Platform}
\label{sec:hardwareplatform}

The initial hardware platform chosen for this project was the PIC18F452 however this project was designed from the ground up to allow for other hardware to be untilized with some effort from the hardware support team. The PIC18F452 was chosen due to its popularity in the industry and low cost.

In addition the PIC18F452 has the following features that are essential for PLC operation:

\begin{itemize}
\item 8 Digital inputs.
\item 8 Digital outputs.
\item Has support for C syntax.
\item Accessable hardware clock.
\item Onboard program memory.
\end{itemize}

These minimum specification have become the baseline for our hardware requirements. In order to utilize a different chip with our programming software the hardware support team will be required to implement a driver layer as described in seciton \ref{sec:hardwareframework}.

For real time operation hardware requirements on clock speed will become more critical execution of ``goto'' should occur as close as possible to constant time or O(1). Without the ability to execute ``goto'' in constant time delays between transitions become increasingly harder to predict and account for.
