Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC) have been around for over 30 years and as such there have been many iterations and designs. The original Programmable Logic Controllers came into being to fill the need of automotive manufacturers replacing traditional relays with digital control. To this day modern PLC's still use graphical analogies of circuits and relays in order to construct their programmable logic.

Mitsubishi Automation, Siemens, and Omron are just a few of the big producers of industry standard PLC's although the shape and form factor differ between manufacturers differ PLC's always consist of 3 distinct parts.  The input module, the main controller unit and the output module. This separation exists due to varying requirements for analog inputs and different output level requirements in order to drive heavy machinery.
