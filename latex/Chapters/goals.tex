\section{Goals}

This project aims to improve on current industrial programmable logic controllers by introducing a more natural graphical programming method. In this project we propose state charts as the method of choice as it is analogous to all current programming languages. It is also important to this project to understand the deficiencies of ladder logic (the current method). This project also aims to understand the original use of programmable logic controllers, as well as what they have been migrated into performing. This analyis should provide further understanding on how the original programming methods have been outpaced by more recent technology.

This project aims to deliver the following:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Proof of concept software IDE.
\item Compiler that will take state chart drawing and compile them to intermediate language that is hardware independent.
\item A translation enviroment that takes the intermediate language and compiles them to the target device. 
\item Hardware demo main controller unit (with OS and drivers).
\item An accompanying IO module. %this might not have enough time
\end{enumerate}
By delivering an initial proof of concept software and hardware ecosystem this project would allow for further development for modernizing programmable logic controllers.
