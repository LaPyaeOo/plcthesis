\section{Goals}

This project aims to improve on current industrial programmable logic controllers by introducing a more natural graphical programming method. In addition we will evaluate how to create a cost effective alternative using off the shelf parts to constuct our own hardware PLC. In the process we aim to produce a final prototype that will have the same basic feature set of modern PLC's. This includes a main controller unit, a input and output unit, and a prototype of a basic IDE that will work in our new visual langugage paradigm. In this project we propose state charts as the method of choice as it is analogous to all current programming languages. It is also important to this project to understand the deficiencies of ladder logic (the current method). In addition we will evaluate the original use of PLC's and if the old methodologies are still applicable to their modern application. This analyis will provide further understanding on how the original programming methods have been outpaced by more recent technology.

This project aims to deliver the following:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Proof of concept software IDE.
\item Compiler that will take state chart drawing and compile them to intermediate language that is hardware independent.
\item A translation enviroment that takes the intermediate language and compiles them to the target device. 
\item Hardware demo main controller unit (with OS and drivers).
\item An accompanying IO module. %this might not have enough time
\end{enumerate}
By delivering an initial proof of concept software and hardware ecosystem this project would allow for further development for modernizing programmable logic controllers.
