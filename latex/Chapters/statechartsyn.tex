\section{Syntax of The State Chart Language}

Abstract syntax of our state chart language:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Expression := Expression Op Expression $|$ Op Expression $|$ Variable $|$ Constant
	\item Value := Expression
	\item Type := Char | Int | Long | Bool | Float
	\item Identifier := [a-zA-Z$\_$]+[a-zA-Z0-9$\_$]*  
	
	\item StoreBlock := Type Identifier = Value | Type Identifier = Value; StoreBlock

	\item Condition := Var Eq Var | Var Eq Condition | Condition Eq Condition
	
	\item Eq := $=$ | $\neq$ | $<$ | $\leq$ | $>$ | $\geq$	
	
	\item Transition := StoreBlock | Condition | Storeblock
\end{itemize}

\end{figure}

In figure \ref{fig:state_storeblock} we see a store block represented as it would be drawn in the tool. Each line of a store block has the format shown in our abstract syntax. A line consists of a type (which in figure \ref{fig:state_storeblock} we have int, and char) an identifier, the equals symbol, and a Value. A value can take the form of several expressions as show in figure \ref{fig:state_storeblock}. Our abstract syntax also allows for many lines to occur in each StoreBlock.
