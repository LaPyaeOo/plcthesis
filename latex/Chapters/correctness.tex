\section{Correctness}
\subsection{The Graph Structure}
The graph structure chosen is simple directed graph in which the syntax and semantics are discussed in detail in sections \ref{sec:statechartsyn}, \ref{sec:statechartsem} respectively. To examine correctness we begin by looking at a basic atom and how it will be translated into the final code.

The simplest case is a diagram in which only the start node exists.
%add picture here.
In this simple example the following generated intermediate code \emphasize{IL} is created.

\begin{lstlisting}
// VARIABLE DECLARATIONS //
BLUID0:
//////////////////////////////////////
//        PROGRAM START             //
//////////////////////////////////////
goto EOF;

EOF:
\end{lstlisting}

In this simple atom of code we can see that there are no variables declared. We have a label inserted at the beginning of the start block so we can re-enter the start block if required. Because there is no other transition or block an automatic transition to \emphasize{EOF} is setup in order to terminate the program.
