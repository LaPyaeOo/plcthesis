- Mention there are commercial tools for ladder logic (not free all different)
- Flash slide for ladder logic motor controller all together.

Conclusion Slide
- Developed a simpler programming language
- We believe that it's easier to learn and much faster to programmer Much easier than ladder logic to learn
- Developed Development Enviroment

Future Work:
- AVR Version of this
- Sub diagrams
- Make the language provably correct
- Certified PLC Programs
